Please note: 

This projet has been developed as an assessment for an undergraduate unit: 
EES4100 - Operating Systems and Network Programming at Victoria University,
Melbourne, Australia. It was created only for educational purposes. 

The project involved the creation of a bridge application, whereby data is 
read from a Modbus server and re transmitted to a BACnet client. 

To achieve this the application must simultaneously operates as both a 
Modbus client and BACnet server, operating in seperate threads. 

Unfortunately, the final application has not been completed and does not 
achieve the desired functionality.
