Please note: 
This projet has been developed as an assessment for an undergraduate unit: 
EES4100 - Operating Systems and Network Programming at Victoria University,
Melbourne, Australia. It was created only for educational purposes. 

The project consists of a bridge application, whereby data is read from a 
Modbus server and re transmitted to a BACnet client. To achieve this the 
application simultaneously operates as both a Modbus client and BACnet server 
in seperate threads. Unfortunately, the final application has not been completed
and does not achieve the desirable functionality.
